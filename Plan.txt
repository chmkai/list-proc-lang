This is a rough list of features that need to be implemented into the language.
1.Printing to screen.
2.At least 5 variables of type integer.
3.Reading variables.
4.Basic arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/).

This will be the framework. On top of that, if time permits, we add-
5.Character variables.
6.Custom functions.
7.Comparisons.
8.Loops.
